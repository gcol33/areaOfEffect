Description: Classifies spatial points relative to polygon boundaries, labeling
    each point as "core" (inside), "halo" (in a buffer zone), or pruning it
    (outside both). Handles projection, buffering, and point-in-polygon
    operations automatically. The default buffer produces equal core and halo
    areas, providing a scale-independent definition of "near the boundary." An
    optional mask clips the buffer to relevant areas such as coastlines.
