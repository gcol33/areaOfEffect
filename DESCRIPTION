Description: Formalizes spatial support at scale for ecological and geographical
    analysis. Given points and support polygons, classifies points as "core"
    (inside original support) or "halo" (inside scaled support but outside
    original), pruning all others. The default scale produces equal core and
    halo areas - a geometrically derived choice requiring no tuning. An optional
    mask enforces hard boundaries such as coastlines. Political borders are
    treated as soft boundaries with no ecological meaning.
