Title: Spatial Support at Scale

Description: Formalizes spatial support at scale. Given a set of points and a
    support polygon, aoe() classifies points as "core" (inside original support)
    or "halo" (inside scaled support but outside original), pruning all others.
    Scale is fixed: the support is expanded by one full stamp from the reference
    point (doubling the distance from reference to boundary). An optional mask
    enforces hard boundaries such as coastlines. Political borders carry no
    special meaning.
