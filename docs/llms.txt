**Spatial Support at Scale**

The `areaOfEffect` package formalizes spatial support at scale. Given a
set of points and one or more support polygons,
[`aoe()`](https://gcol33.github.io/areaOfEffect/reference/aoe.md)
classifies points as “core” (inside original support) or “halo” (inside
the area of effect but outside original support), pruning all points
outside.

## Concept

Political borders are not hard ecological boundaries. Biological
processes do not stop at administrative lines. When sampling within a
political region, observations near the border are influenced by
conditions outside that region.

The **area of effect** (AoE) corrects for this border truncation by
expanding the support outward from its centroid. Points are then
classified:

- **Core**: inside the original support
- **Halo**: outside the original support but inside the expanded area of
  effect
- **Pruned**: outside the area of effect (not returned)

Scale is fixed at 1 (one full stamp), meaning each vertex of the support
boundary is moved to twice its distance from the centroid. This is a
principled default, not a tunable parameter.

Sea boundaries are treated differently from political borders: they are
hard boundaries. An optional mask can be provided to enforce such
constraints.

## Installation

``` r

# Install from GitHub
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("gcol33/areaOfEffect")
```

## Usage

### Single Support

``` r

library(areaOfEffect)
library(sf)

# Create example support polygon (e.g., a country or region)
support <- st_as_sf(
  data.frame(id = 1),
  geometry = st_sfc(st_polygon(list(
    cbind(c(0, 100, 100, 0, 0), c(0, 0, 100, 100, 0))
  ))),
  crs = 32631
)

# Create observation points
pts <- st_as_sf(
  data.frame(id = 1:4),
  geometry = st_sfc(
    st_point(c(50, 50)),   # core (center)
    st_point(c(10, 10)),   # core (inside)
    st_point(c(150, 50)),  # halo (outside original, inside AoE)
    st_point(c(300, 300))  # outside (will be pruned)
  ),
  crs = 32631
)

# Apply area of effect
result <- aoe(pts, support)

# View classification
result$aoe_class
#> [1] "core" "core" "halo"
```

### Multiple Supports (Parallel Processing)

When multiple supports are provided, each is processed independently.
Points can appear multiple times if they fall within multiple AoEs.

``` r

# Two adjacent admin regions
supports <- st_as_sf(
  data.frame(region = c("A", "B")),
  geometry = st_sfc(
    st_polygon(list(cbind(c(0, 50, 50, 0, 0), c(0, 0, 100, 100, 0)))),
    st_polygon(list(cbind(c(50, 100, 100, 50, 50), c(0, 0, 100, 100, 0))))
  ),
  crs = 32631
)

# Points near the shared boundary
pts <- st_as_sf(
  data.frame(id = 1:3),
  geometry = st_sfc(
    st_point(c(25, 50)),   # inside A
    st_point(c(50, 50)),   # on boundary
    st_point(c(75, 50))    # inside B
  ),
  crs = 32631
)

result <- aoe(pts, supports)
# Points may appear in both regions' output (long format)
```

### With a Mask (e.g., Land Boundary)

``` r

# Create land mask (excludes sea)
land <- st_as_sf(
  data.frame(id = 1),
  geometry = st_sfc(st_polygon(list(
    cbind(c(-50, 200, 200, -50, -50), c(0, 0, 150, 150, 0))
  ))),
  crs = 32631
)

# Apply with mask
result <- aoe(pts, support, mask = land)
```

### Diagnostic Summary

``` r

result <- aoe(pts, support)
aoe_summary(result)
#>   support_id n_total n_core n_halo prop_core prop_halo
#> 1          1       3      2      1     0.667     0.333
```

## Function Signature

``` r

aoe(points, support, reference = NULL, mask = NULL)
```

| Argument | Type | Default | Description |
|----|----|----|----|
| `points` | sf (POINT) | required | Points to classify and prune |
| `support` | sf (POLYGON/MULTIPOLYGON) | required | One or more support regions (each row = separate AoE) |
| `reference` | sf (POINT) or NULL | NULL | Reference point; only valid for single support |
| `mask` | sf (POLYGON) or NULL | NULL | Hard boundary; AoE intersected with mask |

## Return Value

An `sf` object containing only supported points, with:

- `support_id` column: identifier for which support the classification
  refers to
- `aoe_class` column: `"core"` or `"halo"`
- `scale` attribute: always `1`

When multiple supports are provided, points may appear multiple times
(once per support whose AoE contains them).

## Design Principles

- **Not a buffer**: AoE is a principled methodological correction, not a
  distance-based operation
- **Fixed scale**: Scale is fixed at 1 to ensure reproducible,
  comparable results
- **Hard boundaries respected**: Optional mask for coastlines or other
  hard constraints
- **Multiple supports**: Process admin regions in parallel with long
  format output
- **Minimal API**: Two functions, clear semantics, no hidden complexity
