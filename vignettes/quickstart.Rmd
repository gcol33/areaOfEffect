## Overview

The `areaOfEffect` package addresses a common problem in spatial ecology: political borders are not ecological boundaries. When sampling within a defined region (e.g., a country or protected area), observations near the border are influenced by conditions outside that region. Simply cropping data to administrative boundaries introduces edge effects.

The **area of effect** (AoE) correction expands the spatial support outward, classifying points as:

- **Core**: inside the original support (fully representative)
- **Halo**: outside the original but inside the expanded AoE (influenced by external conditions)
- **Pruned**: outside the AoE entirely (removed)

## Basic Usage

```{r setup}
library(areaOfEffect)
library(sf)
```

Create a simple support polygon:

```{r support}
support <- st_as_sf(
  data.frame(id = 1),
  geometry = st_sfc(st_polygon(list(
    cbind(c(0, 100, 100, 0, 0), c(0, 0, 100, 100, 0))
  ))),
  crs = 32631
)
```
Create observation points:

```{r points}
pts <- st_as_sf(
  data.frame(
    id = 1:5,
    value = c(10, 20, 15, 25, 30)
  ),
  geometry = st_sfc(
    st_point(c(50, 50)),   # center
    st_point(c(10, 10)),   # near corner
    st_point(c(95, 50)),   # near edge
    st_point(c(120, 50)),  # outside, in halo
    st_point(c(250, 250))  # far outside
  ),
  crs = 32631
)
```

Apply the area of effect:

```{r aoe}
result <- aoe(pts, support)
print(result)
```

The result contains only points inside the AoE, with their classification:

```{r class}
result$aoe_class
```

## Understanding the Transformation

The AoE is constructed by scaling the support geometry outward from a reference point (by default, the centroid). With fixed scale = 1, each boundary vertex is moved to twice its distance from the reference:

$$p' = r + 2(p - r)$$

where $r$ is the reference point and $p$ is each boundary vertex.

This doubles the effective spatial extent while maintaining the shape and orientation of the original support.

## Using a Mask

For coastal regions, sea is a hard boundary that should not be crossed. Provide a mask to constrain the AoE:
```{r mask, eval=FALSE}
# Land polygon (excludes sea)
land <- st_read("path/to/land.shp")

# AoE will be intersected with land
result <- aoe(pts, support, mask = land)
```

## Custom Reference Point

By default, the centroid of the support is used as the reference point. You can specify a different reference:

```{r ref}
# Reference at origin corner
ref <- st_as_sf(
  data.frame(id = 1),
  geometry = st_sfc(st_point(c(0, 0))),
  crs = 32631
)

result_custom <- aoe(pts, support, reference = ref)
```

## Accessing Metadata

The result includes attributes with metadata:

```{r meta}
# Scale used (always 1)
attr(result, "scale")

# Reference point used
attr(result, "reference")
```

## Why Fixed Scale?

The scale is fixed at 1 to ensure:

1. **Reproducibility**: All analyses use the same definition
2. **Comparability**: Results across studies are directly comparable
3. **Interpretability**: "We applied the AoE correction" is unambiguous

If you need to explore different scales, that functionality belongs in separate analysis code, not in the core AoE operator.

## Summary

- `aoe()` classifies points as "core" or "halo" based on their position relative to the original and expanded support
- Points outside the AoE are automatically pruned
- Sea and other hard boundaries can be enforced via the `mask` argument
- Scale is fixed at 1 for methodological consistency
