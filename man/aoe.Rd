\title{Classify and Prune Points by Area of Effect}
\usage{
aoe(
  points,
  support = NULL,
  scale = sqrt(2) - 1,
  method = c("buffer", "stamp"),
  reference = NULL,
  mask = NULL,
  coords = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{points}{An \code{sf} object with POINT geometries.}

\item{support}{One of:
\itemize{
\item \code{sf} object with POLYGON/MULTIPOLYGON geometries
\item Country name or ISO code: \code{"France"}, \code{"FR"}, \code{"FRA"}
\item Vector of countries: \code{c("France", "Germany")}
\item Missing: auto-detects countries containing the points
}}

\item{scale}{Numeric scale factor (default \code{sqrt(2) - 1}, approximately 0.414).
Controls the size of the halo relative to the core:
\itemize{
\item \code{sqrt(2) - 1} (default): equal core/halo areas, ratio 1:1
\item \code{1}: area ratio 1:3 (halo is 3x core area)
}

For \code{method = "buffer"}, determines the target halo area as
\code{original_area * ((1 + scale)^2 - 1)}.

For \code{method = "stamp"}, the multiplier \code{1 + scale} is applied to distances

from the reference point.}

\item{method}{Method for computing the area of effect:
\itemize{
\item \code{"buffer"} (default): Uniform buffer around the support boundary.
Robust for any polygon shape. Buffer distance is calculated to achieve
the target halo area.
\item \code{"stamp"}: Scale vertices outward from the centroid (or reference point).
Preserves shape proportions but only guarantees containment for
star-shaped polygons. May leave small gaps for highly concave shapes.
}}

\item{reference}{Optional \code{sf} object with a single POINT geometry.

If \code{NULL} (default), the centroid of each support is used.
Only valid when \code{support} has a single row and \code{method = "stamp"}.}

\item{mask}{Optional \code{sf} object with POLYGON or MULTIPOLYGON geometry.
If provided, each area of effect is intersected with this mask
(e.
g., land boundary to exclude sea).}

\item{coords}{Column names for coordinates when \code{points} is a data.frame,
e.g. \code{c("lon", "lat")}. If \code{NULL}, auto-detects common names.}
}
\value{
An \code{aoe_result} object (extends \code{sf}) containing only the supported
points, with columns:
\describe{
\item{point_id}{Original point identifier (row name or index)}
\item{support_id}{Identifier for which support the classification refers to}
\item{aoe_class}{Classification: \code{"core"} or \code{"halo"}}
}
When multiple supports are provided, points may appear multiple times
(once per support whose AoE contains them).

The result has S3 methods for \code{print()}, \code{summary()}, and \code{plot()}.
Use \code{aoe_geometry()} to extract the AoE polygons.
}
\description{
Given a set of points and one or more support polygons, \code{aoe()} classifies
points as "core" (inside original support) or "halo" (inside the area of
effect but outside original support), pruning all points outside.
}
\details{
By default, the area of effect is computed using a buffer that produces
equal core and halo areas. This means the AoE has twice the area of the
original support, split evenly between core (inside) and halo (outside).
\subsection{Buffer method (default)}{

Computes a uniform buffer distance \eqn{d} such that the buffered area
equals the target. The buffer distance is found by solving:
\deqn{\pi d^2 + P \cdot d = A_{target}}
where \eqn{P} is the perimeter and \eqn{A_{target}} is the desired halo area.
}

\subsection{Stamp method}{

Applies an affine transformation to each vertex:
\deqn{p' = r + (1 + s)(p - r)}
where \eqn{r} is the reference point (centroid), \eqn{p} is each vertex,
and \eqn{s} is the scale factor. This method preserves shape proportions
but only guarantees the AoE contains the original for star-shaped polygons
(where the centroid can "see" all boundary points).

Points exactly on the original support boundary are classified as "core".

The support geometry is validated internally using \code{\link[sf:valid]{sf::st_make_valid()}}.
